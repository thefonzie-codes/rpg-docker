# Pygame Development Guidelines

These guidelines ensure consistent and maintainable game development practices with Pygame.

## Architecture Principles

* **Object-Oriented Design:** All entities in the game (characters, obstacles, UI elements, etc.) should be implemented as classes to promote encapsulation and reusability.
## Technology Requirements

* **Programming Language:** Use Python as the primary programming language for all game development.
* **Game Framework:** Use Pygame library for handling graphics, sound, input, and other game-related functionality.

## Implementation Practices

* **Entity Structure:** Represent each game entity (player, enemy, projectile, etc.) as a separate class with appropriate properties and methods.
* **Component Organization:** Consider using component-based design for complex entities with multiple behaviors.
* **Inheritance:** Use inheritance hierarchies where appropriate (e.g., a base Entity class with specialized subclasses).
* **Vector Calculations:** Use Pygame vectors for positional and dimensional calculations.
